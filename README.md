# Sibyl System

**Fully Autonomous AI Research System with Self-Evolution**

> Inspired by the pioneering work of [The AI Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist), [FARS](https://analemma.ai/blog/introducing-fars/), and [AutoResearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), Sibyl takes the vision further by building natively on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to fully leverage its agent ecosystem — skills, plugins, MCP servers, and multi-agent teams.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

Sibyl is a **fully automated scientific discovery system** that autonomously drives ML research from literature survey to paper submission. It operates as an **autonomous research organization**: 20+ specialized AI agents debate ideas, design and run GPU experiments, write papers, and critically review their own work — all without human intervention.

What truly sets Sibyl apart is its **dual-loop architecture**:

- **Inner Loop — Research Iteration**: Each project automatically iterates across every dimension — refining hypotheses based on experiment results, re-planning experiments, rewriting papers, pivoting to alternative ideas when needed — until quality meets publication standards.
- **Outer Loop — System Self-Evolution**: Sibyl learns from the research process itself. After every iteration, it classifies issues across 8 categories, tracks which lessons actually improve outcomes, and automatically updates its own agent prompts, scheduling strategies, and architectural patterns. **The system that runs your research is itself getting better at running research.**

### What Makes Sibyl Different?

- **Autonomous Multi-Dimensional Iteration** — Not just "run experiments and write a paper." Every aspect of the research improves automatically across iterations: ideas sharpen through multi-agent debate, experiments expand with better baselines and ablations, writing tightens under 6-agent cross-review, and resource utilization optimizes through GPU scheduling feedback. The quality gate decides when to stop or pivot — no human in the loop.
- **Self-Evolving System** — Most AI research tools are static — they run the same way every time. Sibyl evolves. It extracts lessons from every research iteration (issues, success patterns, efficiency metrics), evaluates their effectiveness over time, and injects proven improvements back into agent prompts. Ineffective lessons are automatically deprioritized. Across projects, the system accumulates institutional knowledge — each project makes every future project better.
- **Claude Code Native** — Not a wrapper around API calls. Built directly on Claude Code's architecture (fork skills, agent teams, MCP tools), inheriting its full ecosystem: SSH remote execution, multi-model collaboration (Claude + GPT-5.4 cross-review), Feishu/Lark cloud sync, and more.

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sibyl-Research/sibyl-research-system.git
cd sibyl-research-system
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

### 2. Configure

Set up your API key and GPU server:

```bash
# Required
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

# GPU server — must be SSH-accessible via ~/.ssh/config
# Create project root config (git-ignored):
cat > config.yaml << 'EOF'
ssh_server: "my-gpu-box"           # SSH host name
remote_base: "/home/user/sibyl"    # Base dir on GPU server
max_gpus: 4                        # GPUs to use
EOF
```

### 3. Configure MCP Servers

Add required MCP servers to `~/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh": { "command": "ssh-mcp-server", "args": ["--config", "~/.ssh/config"] },
    "arxiv": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["arxiv-mcp-server"] }
  }
}
```

> **Optional MCP servers**: Google Scholar (academic search), Codex (GPT-5.4 cross-review), Lark/Feishu (cloud sync), bioRxiv (biology preprints). See [MCP Servers Guide](docs/mcp-servers.md).

### 4. Run

```bash
# Launch Claude Code with Sibyl plugin
claude --plugin-dir ./plugin

# Inside Claude Code:
/sibyl-research:init              # Interactive project setup → generates spec.md
/sibyl-research:start <project>   # Start fully autonomous research loop
```

The system will autonomously: search literature → debate ideas → plan & run GPU experiments → analyze results → write paper → review & iterate → until quality gate passes.

### 5. Monitor

```bash
/sibyl-research:status            # View all project progress
/sibyl-research:debug <project>   # Single-step mode for debugging
```

## Self-Evolution System

Sibyl doesn't just run research — it learns how to run research better. After every iteration, the system analyzes what worked, what failed, and what was inefficient, then automatically updates itself:

```

```

### Why Self-Evolution Actually Works

Most AI systems that claim to "learn" are stateful processes — they accumulate context within a single session, but lose everything when the process restarts. Sibyl takes a fundamentally different approach: **stateless architecture with persistent artifacts**.

- **Every prompt is loaded from disk at call time.** There is no in-memory cache, no long-running daemon. Each agent reads its prompt file (`sibyl/prompts/*.md`) fresh every time it is invoked. If the evolution engine rewrites a prompt, the very next agent call picks up the change — zero restart, zero redeployment.
- **Every agent runs as an independent subprocess.** Skills execute via `python3 -c "..."` in a fresh process, so Python modules are re-imported every time. Code changes in `sibyl/*.py` take effect immediately on the next stage.
- **Config is re-parsed per orchestrator call.** `cli_next()` instantiates a new `Orchestrator` each time, re-reading `config.yaml` from disk. Parameter tuning by the evolution engine is picked up on the next tick.
- **Lesson overlays are plain files.** Experience extracted from past projects is written to `~/.claude/sibyl_evolution/lessons/{agent}.md`. The `load_prompt()` function appends the overlay content on every call — new lessons are injected into the next agent invocation automatically.

This means evolution is not a "batch update" that requires a maintenance window. It is a **continuous, incremental process**: the system that runs iteration N+1 is already different from the one that ran iteration N, because the reflection after iteration N has already modified prompts, overlays, and potentially code on disk. The entire system is designed so that **every file is the source of truth, and every file is read fresh** — making self-evolution a natural consequence of the architecture rather than a bolted-on feature.

**Safety**: All system file modifications are gated by mandatory tests (`.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/`) and tracked via git commits, ensuring every evolution step is reversible and auditable.

**8 Issue Categories**: SYSTEM, EXPERIMENT, WRITING, ANALYSIS, PLANNING, PIPELINE, IDEATION, EFFICIENCY — each automatically routed to the relevant agents. The planner learns to design better experiments, the experimenter learns to use GPUs more efficiently, the writer learns to avoid recurring style issues — all without manual intervention.

## Key Mechanisms

### GPU Parallel Scheduling

The experiment stage reads `task_plan.json`, topologically sorts tasks by dependencies, then greedily assigns parallel execution based on available GPUs:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "train_baseline", "depends_on": [], "gpu_count": 2, "estimated_minutes": 60},
    {"id": "train_model_a", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "train_model_b", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "ablation", "depends_on": ["train_model_a", "train_model_b"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 30}
  ]
}
```

### Cross-Project Self-Evolution

Lessons learned in one project automatically improve all future projects:

1. **Record**: Classify issues (8 categories) and success patterns after each iteration
2. **Analyze**: Aggregate with time-decay weighting (30-day half-life) — recent lessons matter more
3. **Evaluate**: Compare early vs late scores to verify whether lessons actually helped (requires >= 4 occurrences)
4. **Apply**: Generate per-agent prompt overlays — each agent receives only the lessons relevant to its role
5. **Prune**: Ineffective lessons are automatically deprioritized (x0.3), preventing bad advice from persisting
6. **Self-Check**: Detect quality decline, recurring unresolved errors, and ineffective lesson accumulation

### PIVOT Mechanism

When experiment results are unsatisfactory, the supervisor decision agent can trigger PIVOT:

- Analyze whether results support the original hypothesis
- Evaluate whether continued investment is worthwhile
- If PIVOT: roll back to idea debate stage with alternative proposals
- Maximum 6 PIVOT cycles (configurable)
