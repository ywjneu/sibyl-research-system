# Sibyl System

**Fully Autonomous AI Research System with Self-Evolution**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

> Inspired by the pioneering work of [The AI Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist), [FARS](https://analemma.ai/blog/introducing-fars/), and [AutoResearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), Sibyl takes the vision further by building natively on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to fully leverage its agent ecosystem — skills, plugins, MCP servers, and multi-agent teams.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

Sibyl is a **fully automated scientific discovery system** that autonomously drives ML research from literature survey to paper submission — and **evolves itself** by learning from every iteration. Unlike systems that merely assist human researchers, Sibyl operates as an **autonomous research organization**: 20+ specialized AI agents debate ideas, design and run GPU experiments, write papers, and critically review their own work, all without human intervention.

### What Makes Sibyl Different?

- **Claude Code Native** — Not a wrapper around API calls. Built directly on Claude Code's architecture (fork skills, agent teams, MCP tools), inheriting its full ecosystem: SSH remote execution, Playwright browser automation, Feishu/Lark cloud sync, and more.
- **Self-Evolving** — The system learns from its own research iterations. It classifies issues, tracks lesson effectiveness, deprioritizes what doesn't work, and automatically injects proven improvements into agent prompts. Each project makes the system smarter.
- **Fully Autonomous Loop** — Start a research topic, walk away. Sibyl handles literature search, multi-perspective idea debate, experiment planning, GPU-parallel execution, result analysis, paper writing, peer-level review, and quality-gated iteration — looping until the research meets publication standards.

---

## System Overview

Sibyl orchestrates 20+ AI agents through a **19-stage state-machine pipeline**, automatically completing literature survey, idea generation, experiment design & execution, result analysis, paper writing, and peer review. The system supports multi-round iterative optimization with built-in cross-project learning that continuously improves research quality.

### Core Features

- **19-Stage Research Pipeline**: End-to-end automation from literature search to camera-ready paper
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 6-agent debate for idea generation, 6-agent result analysis, 6-agent parallel writing
- **GPU-Parallel Scheduling**: Topological sort + greedy assignment, automatic task dependency and GPU resource management
- **Iterative Optimization Loop**: Quality gate auto-decides whether to continue iterating or terminate, with PIVOT mechanism to switch research directions
- **Cross-Project Self-Evolution**: Automatically extracts lessons, tracks effectiveness, generates agent prompt improvements
- **Multi-Model Collaboration**: Claude Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.4 (Codex) independent cross-review

## Self-Evolution System

Sibyl automatically learns from every research iteration, creating a feedback loop that continuously improves system performance:

```
Research Iteration
       |
       v
  Reflection Agent ──> Record outcome (issues + score + success patterns)
       |
       v
  Evolution Engine ──> Classify issues (7 categories)
       |                    ├── Time-weighted frequency analysis
       |                    ├── Effectiveness tracking (early vs late scores)
       |                    └── Success pattern extraction
       v
  Generate Overlays ──> Inject proven lessons into agent prompts
       |                    ├── Effective lessons: boosted priority
       |                    └── Ineffective lessons: 0.3x deprioritized
       v
  Self-Check ──> Detect anomalies
                    ├── Declining quality trend
                    ├── Recurring system errors
                    └── Ineffective lesson accumulation
```

**Issue Categories**: SYSTEM, EXPERIMENT, WRITING, ANALYSIS, PLANNING, PIPELINE, IDEATION — each routed to the relevant agents for targeted improvement.

## Key Mechanisms

### GPU Parallel Scheduling

The experiment stage reads `task_plan.json`, topologically sorts tasks by dependencies, then greedily assigns parallel execution based on available GPUs:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "train_baseline", "depends_on": [], "gpu_count": 2, "estimated_minutes": 60},
    {"id": "train_model_a", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "train_model_b", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "ablation", "depends_on": ["train_model_a", "train_model_b"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 30}
  ]
}
```

### Cross-Project Self-Evolution

The system automatically extracts lessons from each iteration, tracks effectiveness, and injects verified improvements into agent prompts:

1. **Record**: After each reflection, classify issues (7 categories) and success patterns
2. **Analyze**: Aggregate frequency with time decay (30-day half-life)
3. **Evaluate**: Compare early vs late scores, mark lesson effectiveness (requires >= 4 occurrences)
4. **Apply**: Generate agent-specific prompt overlays; ineffective lessons deprioritized (x0.3)
5. **Self-Check**: Detect quality decline, recurring errors, and ineffective lesson accumulation

### PIVOT Mechanism

When experiment results are unsatisfactory, the supervisor decision agent can trigger PIVOT:

- Analyze whether results support the original hypothesis
- Evaluate whether continued investment is worthwhile
- If PIVOT: roll back to idea debate stage with alternative proposals
- Maximum 6 PIVOT cycles (configurable)
